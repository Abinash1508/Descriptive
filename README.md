### **Key Takeaways**
- **Highest Attrition**: Occurs in younger employees, particularly in the **26-35** age group, and is most common in lower salary brackets (up to 5K).

### **Recommendations**
- **Increase Focus on Early Engagement**: Since attrition is highest within the first year of employment, introducing mentorship programs, personalized career paths, and more robust onboarding could reduce early turnover.

- **Revisit Compensation Structures**: Given the high attrition rates in the lowest salary bracket, a review of the salary structure with potential raises, bonuses, or incentives for low-earning employees may help improve retention.

- **Develop Targeted Retention Programs**: Since specific job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives have higher attrition rates, role-specific retention strategies (e.g., increased support, career progression opportunities) could reduce turnover in these key areas.

- **Focus on Career Development for Mid-Career Professionals**: Employees in the 26-35 age range experience the highest attrition. Offering growth opportunities, leadership training, and work-life balance incentives could help retain this crucial demographic.
